# Master's to PhD
## In Pursuit of a PhD in Finance
Thank you for your interest! As you may know, I'm on medical leave from Duke University and I'm still more than invested in my journey towards Academia. I did so much through undergrad (e.g. taking 18 credits while having a full-time job in M&A, TA for 3 classes and RA for 4 professors, did a research project, studied for GREs), and had the opportunity to be at Goldman Sachs throughout the summer. I'm taking it slower now, but rest assured, I am still more than ambitious.

Between now (September 2023) and application deadlines (December 2023), I plan on doing the following:

1. RA work for Professor Cam Harvey (Duke University)
2. Read books and research papers ([Python to HTML file](http://jenngunawan.pythonanywhere.com/))[^1]
4. Complete University of Chicago's Financial Mathematics class
5. Complete and log certificate programs (e.g. Harvard's CS-50)
6. Complete a supplementary file for my statement of purpose

Thank you again for your interest, and I hope that you'll find me as a competitive candidate for your school.

P.S. I will continue to update this repository and hyperlink this README.md file as time progresses.
