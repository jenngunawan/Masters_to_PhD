# Master's to PhD
## In Pursuit of a PhD in Finance
Thank you for your interest! As you may know, I'm on medical leave from Duke University and I'm more than invested in my journey towards Academia. Between now (September 2023) and application deadlines (December 2023), I plan on doing the following:

1. RA work for Professor Cam Harvey (Duke University)
2. Read books and research papers ([Python to HTML Flask app](http://jenngunawan.pythonanywhere.com/))[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]
4. University of Chicago's MS Financial Mathematics prep course ([Linear Algebra and Python](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/admissions/prep-course/#coursework))
5. Complete and log certificate programs (e.g. Harvard's CS-50)
6. Complete a supplementary file for my statement of purpose

Thank you again for your interest, and I hope that you'll find me as a competitive candidate for your school.

P.S. I will continue to update this repository and hyperlink this README.md file as time progresses.
